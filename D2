If using a diff database and need info from other database then gotta locate it first, like:
SELECT  * 
FROM D1SQL.dbo.EmployeeDemographics 


WHERE statement is used to find specific data. Select the database first.
SELECT * 
FROM EmployeeDemographics 
WHERE Firstname 'Jim' 
WHERE Firstname 'Jim' AND Gender 'Male'        (For 2 Conditions) 
WHERE Firstname 'Jim' OR Gender 'Male'         (For any one Condition) 
WHERE Firstname <> 'Jim'                       ( <> means not) 
WHERE Age >30 
WHERE Age <37 
WHERE Age >= 30 
WHERE Age <= 30 
WHERE Lastname LIKE 'S%'                       ( Everybody whose lastname starts with 'S') 
WHERE Lastname LIKE '%S%'                      ( Everybody who has 'S' in their last name) 
WHERE Lastname LIKE 'S%C%O%T%'                 ( Everybody Whose lastname has SCOT in the same order) 
WHERE Firstname IS NULL                        ( Everybody who don't belong any firstname) 
WHERE Firstname IS NOT NULL                    ( Everybody who has their firstname) 
WHERE Firstname IN ('Jim', 'Michael')          ( IN is like multiple equation(=). It can contain more than one data) 
  
 
GROUP BY , ORDER BY:
SELECT Gender, COUNT (Gender) 
FROM EmployeeDemographics 
Group By Gender

SELECT Gender, COUNT (Gender)                 
FROM EmployeeDemographics 
WHERE Age>30
Group By Gender      

SELECT Gender, Age, COUNT (Gender) 
FROM EmployeeDemographics 
Group By Gender, Age 



SELECT * 
FROM EmployeeDemographics 
ORDER BY Age                                ( Default is ASC= Lower to higher. For numbers= 1, 2, 3,... For letters= A, B, C,...) 

SELECT * 
FROM EmployeeDemographics 
ORDER BY Age  DESC                          ( DESC= Higher to lower) 

SELECT * 
FROM EmployeeDemographics        
ORDER BY Age DESC, Gender DESC 

SELECT * 
FROM EmployeeDemographics 
ORDER BY 4 DESC, 5 DESC                     ( 4 no column is Age's , 5 no column is Gender's)
